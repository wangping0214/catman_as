How transfer the string between C++ server and Actionscript client correctly?

On server side, we set the locale of the C++ server and it's host operating system
to zh_CN.UTF-8, then all multi-byte string are encoded in UTF-8. We don't use
wchar_t in Linux, because it occupies four bytes, it's wasteful. In this way, a C++
string is marshaled as a UTF-8 byte array, then the byte array was sent to client.

On client side, the String was written as an UTF-8 bytes to a byte stream.

So, the server and client side both receive and send UTF-8 byte stream when 
transforming string. It's very consistent and works fine indeed.
